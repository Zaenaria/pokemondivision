# Contributing to Pokémon Division

## First of all thanks for taking your time and coming here!

This file here has a set of guidelines to follow when contributing to this project.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

* Please use GitHub issues tracker to report any new bugs found.
* Please use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe where you experienced this issue and what you think should have happened. 
  (Eg. When pressing right, character is moving left. But it should be moving right.)

### Tell your own Tale!

* If you have a good storyline do tell us your tale and how our hero should advance. 
* Making an awe inspiring game is no simple feat and not everybody is good at telling tales, certainly not me. I would love help in this area!

### Contribute to the repo if you are a coder

* Please send a pull request for all contributions even if it is a single line code change. This helps keep a clean code base.
* Add proper commit messages and comments so that it will be easier to review the code changes.

### Pixel artists are welcome - Always, Anytime and Anywhere!

If you are a pixel artist and would like to contribute please follow the below guidelines for tile art that is submitted.
* The tiles should ideally be 32x32 pixels.
* If a character or object is bigger that this it should be a multiple of 32x32 ie 64x64 etc.
* If the submission is a character, use this template image to design your character.
