# Pokémon Division

![Pokémon logo](/images/pokemonlogohd.png "Pokémon logo")

Pokémon Division is an online MMORPG that is aimed to run all devices based on the famous Pokémon gameboy games.
This game is a work in progress with lots of improvements to be done.

Currently I am working on:
* Adding pokemon to the roster.
* Adding npcs for the player to interact.
* Add a rich map generator to the game for extensive gameplay.
* Add proper sprites for the character and surroundings.
* Add a storyline to kickstart the game.
* Add a Pokédex with updated Pokémon data.

## Controls in Game

When playing on a desktop use w,a,s,d to move the character.

When playing on a touch enabled device touch and drag on the screen to move the character in the desired direction.

# FAQ

Q: Why Html and JavaScript when there are a ton of other languages to choose from?

A: Ease of use and portability. My aim was to bring Pokémon Division to every device alike and keeping that in mind I chose a language that would suit me as well.

Q: Why pure JavaScript and no JQuery?

A: Simple, just to keep the depencies low and the game more lighter. I didnt want to add more data to the game by adding additional dependencies.

Q: Can anybody contribute to Pokémon Division?

A: Yes! I made this open source because I wanted everybody to contribute. Any Pokémon fans out there? Y'all are welcome here to collaborate and showcase your knowledge in Pokémon. There are lot of ways you can contribute, contribute by helping me with the code or contribute with the Pokémon database. Or you can simply leave a star to this Git repo. I will be gratefull for any and all help that I get.

Q: Where did you get the Pokémon data for the Pokédex?

A: Most of the data I had been collecting since my childhood. But some of the more advanced data I referred to [Veekun database](https://veekun.com/) and [PokémondDb](https://pokemondb.net/).

Q: Where did you get the Pokémon art?

A: The art used in this development version was obtained from [The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/) and [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/). I am planning to bring in my own sprites in the near future when I have more time.
