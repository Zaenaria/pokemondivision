# Pokémon Division (WIP-Work In Progress)

Pokémon Division is an online MMORPG that is aimed to run all devices based on the famous Pokémon gameboy games.
This game is a work in progress with lots of improvements to be done.

Currently I am working on:
* Adding pokemon to the roster.
* Adding npcs for the player to interact.
* Add a rich map generator to the game for extensive gameplay.
* Add proper sprites for the character and surroundings.
* Add a storyline to kickstart the game.

## Controls in Game

When playing on a desktop use w,a,s,d to move the character.

When playing in a touch enabled device touch and drag on the screen to move the character in the desired direction.
